# Legal Stuff
This game was made in Flash Pro CC 2015 by Ethan "ScTiger" Rafael. All art assets and code are original.

Main theme is "Professor Umlaut" by Kevin MacLeod:

# Special Thanks
Nathaniel "adumbidiot" Daniel, who helped me with some of the hardest programming in the project, as well as made the level builder. I would not have been able to do this without him.
